Social jukebox web app that allows multiple for users to add songs from Spotify to the playlist. The playlist is 
hosted by a "host," which is simply someone who has a Spotify account. It's great for a party! You can easily set it up by
clicking "Host a party," give your guests your Party ID, and let them go ahead and start firing in songs to the playlist!
